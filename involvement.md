We are always looking for those who are interested in furthering the mission of Socially Responsible Tech. Our work is interdisciplinary, so students and collaborators from any field are welcome.

### Collaborators

Collaborators are always welcome. While not necessarily a part of the lab directly, collaborators should reach out directly to Dr. Ari Schlesinger, and she will work with you to see what works.

### Research Assistants

A Research Assistant (RA) is an essential member of the Socially Responsible Tech Lab. Research assistants are involved in one or more of the following activities: research, technical support, and outreach efforts (for the lab, school, university, and community). RAs are selected on the basis of the following criteria:

1. potential for success in research

2. academic achievement or capabilities

3. interpersonal skills, and

4. ability to serve as a positive role model to peers and other students.

RA onboarding happens at the beginning of each semester. The Socially Responsible Tech Lab meets on Wednesdays (typically in the afternoon). All RAs are required to be at weekly meetings.

*Please note, as the SRT lab is based at the University of Georgia, these meetings are held in person on UGA campus.*

#### Next Steps

Below is some guidance on how to get in touch based on your current education level (i.e., PhD, Master’s, or Undergraduate).

*While the email associated with the lab is regularly checked, you should not necessarily expect a response.*

## PhD Students

**Prospective PHD students** interested in working with Dr. Ari and the SRT lab should reach out to Dr. Ari. She is always willing to chat. Reach out with an explanation of:

 1. what interests you about her research (be specific), 
 2. what excites you about research (aka what motivates your interest in a PhD), and 
 3. a few research publications that you find particularly interesting and why (extra helpful to know about recent publications you find interesting beyond/in addition to my prior work).

Please add the following to the beginning of the email subject line (including the square brackets): [New PHD Student Inquiry]. 

Make sure to check out the UGA School of Computing's website for information about requirements (and please mention me in your application materials). Applications are submitted to the UGA Graduate School. 

**Current UGA PHD Students**, Dr. Ari is likewise interested in chatting with you. Sending her an email outlining your interests and she will reach back as soon as she can to determine whether your work aligns and what you could work on together. 

When you send me an email, please add the following to the beginning of the email subject line (including the square brackets): [Current PHD Student Inquiry].

## Master's Students

**Current Masters Students at UGA** who are interested in working with the lab should first take Dr. Ari's HCI course (CSCI 4800/6800) or her 8000 level graduate seminar. This will help you assess if research in HCC and anti-discriminatory computing is something  you are genuinely interested in, and it will help both you and Dr. Ari to see if you are a good match for working together. 

**As a rule, I require master’s students to take one of my classes as a prerequisite for a master’s student project or thesis under my supervision. This class can be taken as an undergrad**

*Please don't send a generic, copy-paste email. Dr. Ari is busy, and is unable to respond to all emails she recieves. Take notes from what is required of PHD students, and note that generic emails are less likely to get a response*

## Undergraduate Students

**Current Undergraduate Students at UGA**, there is space for you too!

If you’re interested in working as an undergraduate research assistant in the Socially Responsible Tech Lab, [please fill out this interest form](https://forms.gle/AHiTpVeNBZE6wYdL9) to help me get to know you. (Details about the interest form below.)

If you have questions, you can also directly email Dr. Ari 

If you send an email, please include:
1. what interests you about my research lab (be specific), 
2. information about your goals (e.g., getting research experience, learning a new skill, getting a recommendation letter, etc.), and 
3. a copy of your CV/resume. 

Additionally, make sure to add the following to the beginning of the email subject line (including the square brackets): [UGA Student Inquiry] 

If you’re early in your journey at UGA, that’s great! Long term collaboration is greatly appreciated, and is both an excellent way to develop your skills over time and for us to get to know you. 

If you’re not sure about research but you want to learn more, a good first step is to take Dr. Ari's HCI course, CSCI 4800/6800. I tend to teach this course in the Fall semester. This is required if you wish to collaborate at the graduate level, and is an excellent place to start. 

#### Undergrad Interest Form Details

The interest form covers 
1. basic info about yourself, 
2. short answers about your interest in research and your goals, 
3. a place to upload documents (resume, writing sample, unofficial transcripts, etc.), 
4. information about a name and contact for a reference, and 
5. details about time commitments, selection criteria, etc. 

To help you prep to fill out the interest form, the short answer questions in part 2 include: 

What interests you about our research lab?

What are your goals?

OPTIONAL: If you've read any research papers by Dr. Schlesinger or her students, which paper(s) have you read and what did you find interesting about them? 

OPTIONAL: Is there anything else you would like to share about yourself/think we should know? 

*Please note, all students are expected to contribute 5 hours of work per week as a general minimum, on top of the weekly meetings. If you cannot meet this minimum, please either reach out to Dr. Ari or consider reapplying in a different semester.*
